[DNS (Domain Name System)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) provide a simple way for us to communicate on the internet without remembering complex numbers. When we try to connect to a website like google.com, we call an ip address like 172.217.18.206 (man dig). DNS allow to search google.com and replace the name with the good IP because it's easier to remember adress than IP.
