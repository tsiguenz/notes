### Firewall

A [firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(computing)) is a network security responsible for determining what traffic is allowed to enter and exit.

It can control:
- Where the traffic is incoming from.
- Where the traffic is going to.
- What port is the traffic for.
- What protocol is the trafic using.

Two category of firewall exists:

| Firewall category | Description |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| Stateful | Use the entire informations of a connection. Determine the behaviours of the entire connection. Consumes a lots of ressources and can block the entire device. |
| Stateless | Use a static set of rules to determine what packets are acceptable or not. Don't block the entire device but only some packets. Consume fewer ressources but if a rule is not exactly matched it's useless. |

### VPN

[VPN (Virtual Private Network)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) allow to extend a private network accross a public network securely by creating dedicated path between each other over the internet. Devices connected within this tunnel form their own private network. These connection is obviously securised with encryption.

VPN benefits:
- Allow networks in differents geographical locations to be connected.
- Offers privacy thanks to encryption. Datas is'nt vulnerable to sniffing.
- Offers anonyminity used in country where freedom of speech is controlled for exemple. The level of anonymity a VPN provides is only as much as how other devices on the network respect privacy.. For example, a VPN that logs all of your data/history is essentially the same as not using a VPN.
